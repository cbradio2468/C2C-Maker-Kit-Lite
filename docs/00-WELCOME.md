# Welcome to Catalyst To Courage

## ðŸŒŸ You're Here Because You Want to Build Something That Matters

This isn't your typical "learn to code" tutorial. This is about **building with purpose**.

### The Problem

Every year, thousands of people have brilliant ideas for helping their communities:
- A single mom who knows exactly what other single parents need
- A person with a disability who sees how to make life easier for others
- A teacher who understands what students are really struggling with
- An immigrant who knows the gaps in support systems

**They have the knowledge. They have the passion. They have $100 and a dream.**

What they DON'T have:
- $100,000 for developers
- Years to learn complex coding
- Access to expensive tools
- Time to figure out deployment, hosting, and databases

### The Solution

**Catalyst To Courage** exists to change this.

We believe:
1. The people closest to problems have the best solutions
2. Technology should serve those who need it most
3. Building software should be accessible to everyone
4. Mission comes before monetization

## ðŸ’­ A Note on "Good Enough"

You don't need to build the next Facebook.

You need to build something that:
- âœ… Solves ONE problem really well
- âœ… Is secure and protects user data
- âœ… Works on mobile phones (where your users are)
- âœ… Costs almost nothing to run
- âœ… Makes someone's life measurably better

That's it. That's success.
